Integration Solution
Overview
This solution, Integration, is a multi-project system designed to handle API routing, authentication, real-time communication, and client-server interaction. The solution includes the following projects:

ApiGateway: Centralized API management and routing.
IdentityServer: Authentication and authorization.
SignalR: Real-time server-side communication.
SignalRClient: Client-side implementation for real-time updates.
Projects
1. ApiGateway
Purpose:
Acts as the central gateway for API routing and traffic management.
Technologies:
YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy).
Features:
Handles API forwarding, rate-limiting, and logging.
Implements custom request and response transformations.
2. IdentityServer
Purpose:
Provides authentication and identity management.
Technologies:
IdentityServer4 or Duende IdentityServer.
Features:
Secure token issuance using OAuth2/OpenID Connect.
Role-based and policy-based access control.
3. SignalR
Purpose:
Implements server-side real-time communication.
Technologies:
ASP.NET Core SignalR.
Features:
Supports WebSockets, Server-Sent Events (SSE), and long polling.
Broadcasts messages to connected clients in real-time.
4. SignalRClient
Purpose:
Client-side application to interact with the SignalR server.
Technologies:
.NET SignalR Client or JavaScript/TypeScript for web-based clients.
Features:
Sends and receives real-time updates.
Handles user interactions and updates UI dynamically based on server notifications.

Project Relationships
ApiGateway:
Routes requests to the appropriate services (e.g., IdentityServer or SignalR).
IdentityServer:
Manages authentication for both ApiGateway and SignalR clients.
SignalR:
Provides real-time communication for authenticated clients via ApiGateway.
SignalRClient:
Connects to SignalR for receiving real-time updates and notifications.
